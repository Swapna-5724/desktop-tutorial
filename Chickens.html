        The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red jungleflow</a> <br>
        (Gallus gallus), originally native toSoutheast Asia. It was first domesticated around <br>
        8,000 years ago and is one of the most common and widespread domesticated animals in <br>
        the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also <br>
        kept as pets.[1]

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered 
        in most breeds, and the wings are short.<sup><a href="source.com">[20]</a></sup> Wild junglefowl can fly, 
        whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.
        <sup>[21]</sup> Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.<sup>[20]</sup> Newly hatched chicks of both modern
        and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day
         35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage 
         chicken of the same age.<sup>[22]</sup>

        <p>Chickens are susceptible both to parasites such as mites, and to diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria
           and viruses. The parasite Dermanyssus gallinae feeds on blood, causing irritation and reducing egg production,
           and acts as a vector for bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis and spirochaetosis.[76] Viral diseases include
           avian influenza.[77] Use by humans</p>

        Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb
        or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called
        wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation
         that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]

        Chickens are omnivores.<sub>[24]</sub> In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for <br>
        seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,<sub>[25]</sub> and young <br>
        mice.<sub>[26]</sub> A chick en may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.<sub>[27]</sub> The <br>
        world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.<sub>[28]</sub>

    <p>
        Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally.
        Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take 
        priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was
        described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[29][30] 
        Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[31] Chickens are capable of mobbing
        and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[32] Chickens have been thought 
        of primarily as providers of food, but their cognition, emotions, and sociality are comparable with
        other birds and mammals.[33]

    <p>
        A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other <br>
        males,[34] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly <br>
        after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate <br>
        that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.[35]

     <h2>Cuttlefish</h2>
    <p>Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the family Sepiidae. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes
       squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
       Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure 
       their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia 
       apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
    </p>
    <p>Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, 
       larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 
       1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one
       of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]
    </p>
    <p>The "cuttle" in "cuttlefish", which is itself sometimes used to refer to these animals,[5] is derived from the Old English 
        name for the group, cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).
        [6] 116 species of cuttlefish are currently recognized;[7] for decades, the classification of this family relied on just three
        genera: Metasepia, Sepia, and Sepiella, with Sepia containing most of the species and several subgenera.[citation needed] A 
        2023 paper shifted this perception by having recovered Sepia as containing several monophyletic groups or clades. The authors 
        subsequently revived several synonymized genera and elevated some subgenera of Sepia to full genus level, reassigning many 
        species of Sepia to these revived genera. Conversely, Metasepia was found to nest within one of these revived genera, and as
         it was named after Ascarosepion it became a junior synonym of that genus.[8]

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod 
        eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates, such as humans.[18] Superficial similarities between cephalopod and 
        vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape.
        [19][20] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[21] they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their 
        perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to 
        look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with 
        respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, 
        because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern 
        depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both eyes.[22][23]
    </p>
        <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
        <p>Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone, a highly modified 
            internal shell, which is porous and is made of aragonite. Except for Spirula, they are the only coleoid cephalopods 
            with a shell with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.[15] The pores provide it with buoyancy, 
            which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral 
            siphuncle.[16] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The 
            cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives.[17]

        <h2>The Subheader</h2>
        <p>When not nested within sectioning content, <main>, or an element with the same ARIA 
            role as these elements' implicit ARIA role, then the <header> element has an identical 
                meaning to the site-wide banner landmark role. It defines a global site header, 
                which usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global 
                navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page. Otherwise, 
                when nested within said elements, it loses its landmark status and represents a group 
                of introductory or navigational aids for the surrounding section. It usually contains 
                the surrounding section's heading (an h1 – h6 element) and optional subheading, but this 
                is not required.</p>
